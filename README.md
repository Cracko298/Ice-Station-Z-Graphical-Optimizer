# Ice-Station-Z-Graphical-Optimizer
A simple tool that changes the graphical settings in Ice Station Z PC/Steam. So lower-end machines can play as well. 

Or just crank your Graphics to the max and play on the highest graphics possible in Ice Station Z PC/Steam.

Sometimes the Tool will register as a virus. This is a false positive. Meaning Windows is confused as to what the application does.

And because it's messing with .ini files which are configuration files. It thinks the tool is a virus when it isn't.
