# Ice-Station-Z-Tools
A few simple tools to improve the user experience in Ice Station Z PC/Steam.

Crank your Graphics to the max and play on the highest graphics possible or mess around with bloom and motion blurr.

If you get an Error on the Graphical Optimizer or any of the application's don't worry. Their's another way. (Just very tedious)

- Download the "meta" folder/zip file.

- Extract it to your downloaded location.

- Go to your desired folder inside of the "meta" folder.

- Copy the selected .ini

- And go to %APPDATA% in the Windows Run/File Explorer. (or just go here: C:\Users\ %USERNAME% \AppData\Local\ISZ\Saved).

- Navagate to the "config" folder, Then the "WindowsNoEditor" folder. 

- Then paste your selected file and overwrite any files that Windows indicates need to be overwritten.

If you REAALLLY, want to download the applications and test your luck. The links are located below.

Sometimes these Tools will register as a "virus". This is a false positive. Meaning Windows is confused as to what the application actually does.

And because it's messing with .ini/Log files which are configuration & Log files. It thinks the tool is a virus when it isn't. (Just settings).
